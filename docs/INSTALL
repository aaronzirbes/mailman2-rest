Installation

Unzip this archive to the following folder:
	/usr/share/mailman-rest/

cd /usr/share
sudo tar -xvzf ~/mailman-rest.tar.gz

copy the 'list_all_members' python script to your mailman installation

cd /usr/share/mailman-rest
sudo cp utils/list_all_members /usr/lib/mailman/bin/

Add the lines from conf/sudoers into your /etc/sudoers file

cd /usr/share/mailman-rest
cat conf/sudoers | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers

Add the lines from apache2.conf into the approriate apache
VirtualHost configuration (or apache2.conf)

There's no easy command for this.  You'll have to paste it into your...
	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/your_mailman_site
...file.

run the following to update the permissions on the shell
scripts

sudo chown list:list /usr/share/mailman-rest/bin/*
sudo chmod 0770 /usr/share/mailman-rest/bin/*

That should be it.

OPTIONAL STUFF

If you need/want to see your aliases via a REST interface, you can
Wrap the section of your aliases file you wish to have exposed in the 
following formated comment block.  Then you can uncomment the PHP
action in your apache config file.

## BEGIN ALIASES ##
samplealias:	sample@example.com
