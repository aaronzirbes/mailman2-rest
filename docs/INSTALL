Unzip this archive to the following folder:
	/usr/share/mailman-rest/

cd /usr/share
sudo tar -xvzf ~/mailman-rest.tar.gz

copy the 'list_all_members' python script to your mailman installation

cd /usr/share/mailman-rest
sudo cp utils/list_all_members /usr/lib/mailman/bin/

Add the lines from conf/sudoers into your /etc/sudoers file

cd /usr/share/mailman-rest
cat conf/sudoers | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers

Add the lines from apache2.conf into the approriate apache
VirtualHost configuration (or apache2.conf)

There's no easy command for this.  You'll have to paste it into your...
	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/your_mailman_site
...file.

run the following to update the permissions on the shell
scripts

chown list:list /usr/share/mailman-rest/bin/*
chmod 0770 /usr/share/mailman-rest/bin/*

That should be it.
